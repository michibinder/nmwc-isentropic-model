## Downslope windstorms with an isentropic model

This report continues on the work of developing a two-dimensional isentropic model to study the nonlinear flow of a stratified atmosphere past a mountain ridge. In general, the model is capable of simulating moist flow with simple cloud microphysics parameterizations like the warm-rain bulk- microphysics scheme following Kessler (Kessler, 1969), but this report is mainly focused on the investigation of a phenomenon called ##downslope windstorm##. Nevertheless, the effect of moist processes coupled with the dynamics are considered as well.
